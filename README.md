### About Me

- Currently learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) through side projects.
- My Bio is a lie. I do in fact have time to program recreationally... if given sufficient motivation. Usually that motivation is making tools or mods for whatever video game I'm currently playing.
- I unironically believe that FizzBuzz is a good interview question.
