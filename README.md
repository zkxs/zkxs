### About Me
- I'm currently learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) through side projects. I've learned a lot, but there's still more to go.
- Most of my programming time is spent professionally, but sometimes if I have the right inspiration I'll do some recreational programming as well. I've dabbled in:
  - Command-line utilities
  - Unity game modding
  - Reverse engineering
  - Discord bots
- To get in contact with me you can email me at [zkxs00@gmail.com](mailto:zkxs00@gmail.com). For bonus points, alter that email address by adding `+realboy` immediately before the @ sign. Doing this will help distinguish you from email bots.

### About My Work
- I worked for 5 years as a software developer for [@walmartlabs](https://github.com/walmartlabs) doing primarily backend Java across a couple projects:
  - Large scale processing of aisle imagery captured by a robot
  - Internal GraphQL/Spring API that crossreferenced data from a variety of different sources
- I currently work as a software developer for [@oracle](https://github.com/oracle), doing backend Java in a project that keeps track of firmware installations in Oracle's cloud
